# Lox in Rust

This is my implementation of the Lox programming language in Rust, following the "Crafting Interpreters" textbook by Robert Nystrom. Lox is a simple dynamically-typed programming language that is often used for educational purposes. Rust is a fast, reliable, and safe programming language that is well-suited for systems programming and building high-performance applications.

This implementation is a work-in-progress and is intended for learning purposes. Feel free to use it as a reference or to contribute to the project.
